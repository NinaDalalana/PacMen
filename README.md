# PacMen Factory
MIT xPro code assignment. PacMen Factory was an exercise on creating and animating DOM elements by interacting with buttons available on the screen. New "PacMen" image elements show as the user clicks on "Add PacMan". The added image elements will start moving by clicking on "Start Game". PacMen images will move randomly across the screen, detecting when they hit the edge of their bounding element and changing direction.
